I feel like this is pretty obious, but I will still write it out because it is can really change to society compared to anything we have seen up until now.

What is Ellon Musk doing these days?
Think about is..
He already have the Tesla driving itself without a driver now with the Summit function.
The car can also switch battery or automaticlly connect it self to the power outlet.
He now have a spaceship (SpaceX) that, in addition to going out to space, now can land again and be reused.
In addition to these two projects he have now also started on something called Hyperloop.
A transportation system that looks like the old kind of pneumatic tubes system but work in a little different way.
Hyperloop enable people to travel in up to 8000km/h by reducing the airpressure in the tube and have capsules travel with a technology similar to airhockey.
