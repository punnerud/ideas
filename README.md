My business ideas made Open Source

For years I have had a lot of business ideas.
I don't belive in patents and I don't belive in holding the ideas secret.
I am a beliver of focus and hard work, thats why I decided to put my business ideas out in the public.
This way I hope to get feedback or to inspire others to build further the ideas.
