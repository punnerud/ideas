A Raspberry Pi testsenter for SW

Basic workings:
- A master RPi that can manage other RPi's
  - flash SD-card
  - turn the power on/off
  - ethernet, USB, HDMI and GPIO is connected to a special switch so the master is able to read the signals from these ports

- SD-cards on slaves to master workings:

  - The GPIO wires from the master is directly connected to the SD-card when it is inserted into the slave
  - Warning: Enable reading/writing to by the master when the slave is operating.
    - This can be used for debugging, snap-shots, antivirus checking, data-transfer between master+slave
